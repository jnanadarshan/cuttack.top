### How to Use

If you aren't familiar with Jekyll yet, you should know that it is a static site generator. It will transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. No more databases, slow loading websites, risk of being hacked...just your content. And not only that, with Jekyll you get free hosting with GitHub Pages! This page itself is free hosted on Github with the help of Jekyll and Mediumish template that you're currently previewing. If you are a beginner we recommend you start with
[Jekyll's Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"}
